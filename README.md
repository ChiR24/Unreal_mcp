A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI assistants to control Unreal Engine through the native C++ Automation Bridge plugin. Built with TypeScript and C++ for high-performance game development automation.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Asset Management** - Browse, import, and create materials
- **Actor Control** - Spawn, delete, and manipulate actors with physics
- **Editor Control** - PIE sessions, camera, and viewport management
- **Level Management** - Load/save levels, lighting, and environment building
- **Animation & Physics** - Blueprints, state machines, ragdolls, constraints, vehicle setup
- **Visual Effects** - Niagara particles, GPU simulations, procedural effects
- **Sequencer** - Cinematics, camera animations, and timeline control
- **Console Commands** - Safe execution with dangerous command filtering

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Unreal Engine 5.0-5.6
- Required UE Plugins (enable via **Edit â–¸ Plugins**):
  - **MCP Automation Bridge** â€“ Native C++ WebSocket automation transport (ships inside `plugins/McpAutomationBridge`)
  - **Editor Scripting Utilities** â€“ Unlocks Editor Actor/Asset subsystems for native tool operations
  - **Sequencer** *(built-in)* â€“ Keep enabled for cinematic tools
  - **Level Sequence Editor** â€“ Required for `manage_sequence` operations

> ðŸ’¡ After toggling any plugin, restart the editor to finalize activation. The MCP Automation Bridge provides all automation capabilities through native C++ handlers.

### Plugin feature map

| Plugin | Location | Used By | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| MCP Automation Bridge | Project Plugins â–¸ MCP Automation Bridge | All automation operations | Primary C++ automation transport with native handlers |
| Editor Scripting Utilities | Scripting | Asset/Actor subsystem operations | Supplies Editor Actor/Asset subsystems |
| Sequencer | Built-in | Sequencer tools | Ensure not disabled in project settings |
| Level Sequence Editor | Animation | Sequencer tools | Required for `manage_sequence` operations |

> Tools such as `physics.configureVehicle` accept an optional `pluginDependencies` array so you can list the specific Unreal plugins your project relies on (for example, Chaos Vehicles or third-party vehicle frameworks). When provided, the server will verify those plugins are active before running the configuration.

### MCP Automation Bridge plugin
- Location: `plugins/McpAutomationBridge`
- Installation: copy the folder into your project's `Plugins/` directory and regenerate project files.
- Sync helper: run `npm run automation:sync -- --engine "X:/Unreal_Engine/UE_5.6/Engine/Plugins" --project "X:/Newfolder(2)/Game/Unreal/Trial/Plugins" --clean-engine --clean-project` after repo updates to copy the latest bridge build into both plugin folders and strip legacy entries (such as `SupportedTargetPlatforms: ["Editor"]`) that trigger startup warnings.
- Verification: run `npm run automation:verify -- --project "C:/Path/To/YourProject/Plugins" --config "C:/Path/To/YourProject/Config/DefaultEngine.ini"` to confirm the plugin files and automation bridge environment variables are in place before launching Unreal.
- Configuration: enable **MCP Automation Bridge** in **Edit â–¸ Plugins**, restart the editor, then set the endpoint/token under **Edit â–¸ Project Settings â–¸ Plugins â–¸ MCP Automation Bridge**. The bridge ships with its own lightweight WebSocket client, so you no longer need the engine's WebSockets plugin enabled.
- Startup: after configuration, the Output Log should show a successful connection and the `bridge_started` broadcast; `SendRawMessage` becomes available to Blueprint and C++ callers for manual testing.
- Current scope: manages a WebSocket session to the Node MCP server (`ws://127.0.0.1:8090` by default), performs optional capability-token handshakes, dispatches inbound JSON to native C++ handlers, implements reconnect backoff, and responds to editor functions, property operations, blueprint actions, and more through native implementations.
- Usage: all consolidated tools use the automation bridge for native C++ execution. Keep the plugin enabled for all workflows.
- Diagnostics: the `ue://automation-bridge` MCP resource surfaces handshake timestamps, recent disconnects, pending automation requests, and whether the Node listener is runningâ€”handy when validating editor connectivity from a client.
- Roadmap: expand the bridge with elevated actions (SCS authoring, typed property marshaling, modal mediation, asset workflows).

### Installation

#### Option 1: NPM Package (Recommended)

```bash

npm install -g unreal-engine-mcp-server

# Or install locally in your project
npm install unreal-engine-mcp-server
```

#### Option 2: Clone and Build

```bash

git clone https://github.com/ChiR24/Unreal_mcp.git
cd Unreal_mcp

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Run directly
node dist/cli.js
```

### Unreal Engine Configuration

No additional engine configuration required. The MCP Automation Bridge plugin handles all automation through native C++ code.

## Key Features

- **Native C++ Automation** - All operations route through the MCP Automation Bridge plugin's native C++ handlers
- **Graceful Degradation** - Server starts even without an active Unreal connection
- **On-Demand Connection** - Retries automation handshakes with backoff instead of persistent polling
- **Non-Intrusive Health Checks** - Uses echo commands every 30 seconds while connected
- **Command Safety** - Blocks dangerous console commands
- **Input Flexibility** - Vectors/rotators accept object or array format
- **Asset Caching** - 10-second TTL for improved performance

### Native C++ Architecture

The server uses a 100% native C++ approach: all automation operations are implemented as native C++ handlers in the MCP Automation Bridge plugin (under `plugins/McpAutomationBridge/Source/`). This eliminates dependencies and provides better performance, reliability, and type safety.

Configuration and runtime defaults are centralized in `src/constants.ts`. All operations route through the automation bridge's WebSocket protocol to native plugin handlers.

## Supported Asset Types

Blueprints, Materials, Textures, Static/Skeletal Meshes, Levels, Sounds, Particles, Niagara Systems

## Example Console Commands

- **Statistics**: `stat fps`, `stat gpu`, `stat memory`
- **View Modes**: `viewmode wireframe`, `viewmode unlit`
- **Gameplay**: `slomo 0.5`, `god`, `fly`
- **Rendering**: `r.screenpercentage 50`, `r.vsync 0`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
UE_PROJECT_PATH="C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Unreal Projects/YourProject"  # Absolute path to your .uproject file
LOG_LEVEL=info                       # debug | info | warn | error
MCP_AUTOMATION_WS_HOST=127.0.0.1     # Host interface for the automation bridge WebSocket server
MCP_AUTOMATION_WS_PORT=8090          # Port for the automation bridge WebSocket server
MCP_AUTOMATION_WS_PORTS=8090,8091    # Comma-separated list of ports to listen on simultaneously
MCP_AUTOMATION_WS_PROTOCOLS=mcp-automation # Preferred WebSocket subprotocols
MCP_AUTOMATION_CAPABILITY_TOKEN=     # Optional capability token for handshake security
MCP_AUTOMATION_BRIDGE_ENABLED=true   # Set to false to disable the automation bridge
```

Note on configuration precedence
- Environment variables (.env / system env) override runtime defaults defined in `src/constants.ts`. The constants file documents safe defaults and provides typed fallbacks when env values are absent (useful for local dev, tests, and CI). Keep secrets in `.env` or a secret manager â€” do not store secrets in `src/constants.ts`.

Mock mode
- For offline development or CI without an Editor, set `UNREAL_MCP_MOCK_MODE=1` to run tests and tools against a local mock bridge. This is useful for unit tests and continuous integration where launching the Editor is impractical.
