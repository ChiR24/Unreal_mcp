## 2024-05-22 - [Arbitrary File Read in LogTools]
**Vulnerability:** The `LogTools.readOutputLog` function allowed reading any file on the system if its path was provided in `logPath`. The validation only checked if the file existed and was a file, but did not enforce the `.log` extension or the `Saved/Logs` directory restriction, despite the documentation/memory claiming otherwise.
**Learning:** Comments or external documentation (memory) are not reliable sources of truth for security guarantees. Always verify implementation details. `path.resolve` alone does not prevent access to sensitive files if the initial input is not restricted.
**Prevention:** Explicitly validate file extensions and ensure the resolved path starts with an allowed root directory. Use `path.normalize` and check prefix matching to prevent traversal attacks.
