# Unreal Tool Automated Test Cases

These scenarios feed the automated harness in `tests/run-unreal-tool-tests.mjs`. Every row uses a JSON payload the runner can execute directly without manual edits.

**Placeholders**

- `{{FBX_TEST_MODEL}}` resolves to a writable FBX file path. By default it maps to `C:\\Users\\micro\\Downloads\\Compressed\\fbx\\test_model.fbx`; override with the `UNREAL_MCP_FBX_DIR` or `UNREAL_MCP_FBX_FILE` environment variables if needed.
