# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.5] - 2025-10-03
### Added
- Expose `UE_PROJECT_PATH` environment variable across runtime config, Smithery manifest, and client example configs. This allows tools that need an absolute .uproject path (e.g., engine_start) to work without additional manual configuration.
- Added `projectPath` to the runtime `configSchema` so Smithery's session UI can inject a project path into the server environment.

### Changed
- Make `createServer` a synchronous factory (removed `async`) and updated `createServerDefault` and `startStdioServer` to use the synchronous factory. This aligns the exported default with Smitheryâ€™s expectations and prevents auto-start mismatches in the bundled output.
- Provide a default for `ueHost` in the exported `configSchema` so the Smithery configuration dialog pre-fills the host input.

### Documentation
- Updated `README.md`, `claude_desktop_config_example.json`, and `mcp-config-example.json` to include `UE_PROJECT_PATH` and usage notes.
- Updated `smithery.yaml` and `server.json` manifest to declare `UE_PROJECT_PATH` and default values.

### Build
- Rebuilt the Smithery bundle and TypeScript output to ensure schema and defaults are exported in the distributed artifact.

### Fixes
- Fixes Smithery UI blank ueHost field by defining a default in the runtime schema.


## [0.4.4] - 2025-09-30
- Previous release notes retained in upstream repo.
